## CIT 281 Project 03

In this project, we had to:
Create a "coinage" code module that is capable of calculating the total value of coin objects. After completing the "coinage" code module functionality, we had to  update the "server" code file as a true Node.js web server using the Fastify package. The initial web page was then loaded from a file.

Throughout the project, I learned how to take a word problem of sorts and turn it into code that serves a function. I also got to practice with Fastify and GET verbs more.
