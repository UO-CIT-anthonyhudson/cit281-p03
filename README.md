## CIT 281 Project 02

In this project, we had to:
- Use the command line interface (CLI) of your operating system to create and work with a git repository (repo)
- Refactor the JavaScript program from the previous project to practice using git and practice refactoring
- Use git via VSCode
  - Create and use a .gitignore file
  - Diff split screen


Throughout the project, I learned how to use git with my CLI and VSCode. I also learned how to refactor JS code.
